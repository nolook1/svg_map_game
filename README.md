# svg_map_game
Testing out to see how feasible it would be to make a grand strategy game with dynamic borders using svgs.
Built apon my other repo for the ability to draw svg's in a world space, using bevy as the game engine.
Early testing stages so nothing is set in stone, would love feedback and suggestions.


================================

CONTROLS-

E - enable/ disable drawing

Left Mouse Button - start/ pause/ resume drawing

(when the svg meets another svg/ you cannot draw anymore/ in the console it will ask you if you are finished drawing y for yes, it will complete the svg/ n for no, you get a cooldown for two seconds or so)

DEBUG CONTROLS-

F11 - enable/ disable FPS

F12 - enable/ disable spatial grid (green grid) and svg segments (purple lines)
