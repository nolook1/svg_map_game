# svg_map_game
Testing out to see how feasible it would be to make a grand strategy game with dynamic borders using svgs.
Built apon my other repo for the ability to draw svg's in a world space, using bevy as the game engine.
Early testing stages so nothing is set in stone, would love feedback and suggestions.
